# Why analyze PMA data with R?

Like all IPUMS data projects, IPUMS PMA data is available free of charge to users who agree to our [terms of use](https://ipums.org/about/terms). That's because we believe that cost and institutional affiliation should not be barriers to answering pressing concerns around women's health. 

**In fact, users can analyze IPUMS PMA data with any software they like!** We've chosen to highlight R, in particular, because it is also free and popular with data analysts throughout the world. It's available for Windows, MacOS, and a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux).

<aside>
For non-R users: IPUMS data extracts are available as CSV or fixed-width DAT with syntax files formatted for SPSS, Stata, and SAS.

To get a copy of R for yourself, visit the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) (CRAN), select a "mirror" near you, and choose the right download link for your operating system.

## Do I really need special software? 

If you're new to data analysis, you might wonder exactly what you're going to find in a toolkit like R. 

Plenty of people come to R after working with more common types of data analysis software, like Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet programs. If you wanted to, you could absolutely download a CSV file from the IPUMS PMA extract system and open it in Excel. You would find individual **respondents in rows** and their responses for **variables in columns**, and you could make use of built-in spreadsheet functions to do things like:

* Calculate and visualize the distribution of a variable
* Build pivot tables and graphs examining basic relationships between variables
* Create new variables of your own that combine data from several variables

However, you might also notice that a spreadsheet comes with certain limitations:

* There is no variable "metadata", including labels for the variables and each response option. For example, you might see that the responses to a certain variable include the numbers 0, 1, and 99 - what do these values actually mean?
* You might find yourself repeating the same "point" and "click" procedure over and over. Or, maybe you've had to build a library of custom *macro* functions on your own to help automate those procedures. 
* While you can perform arithmetic with built-in functions, there is little support for more advanced statistical procedures 
* Graphics are limited within a set of pre-built templates
* Merging data from external sources (like spatial data) can be very tricky

Statistical software is designed specifically to address these and other issues related to data cleaning and analysis. Learning a program like R takes *a lot of practice*, but doing so will almost certainly make your work much more efficient!

## Are there alternatives?

Yes! Many data analysts use proprietary statistical software like [Stata](https://www.stata.com/), [SAS](http://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html), or [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics). These tools are also powerful, and you may find them easier to use than R.

Coming soon, we hope to include Stata code for many of the blog posts currently written in R.

Beyond price, R has a few additional advantages that make it a particularly useful tool for working with PMA data:

* **Community support:** R users are particularly active on forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/). Groups like [R-ladies](https://rladies.org/) even organize in-person meetups in cities around the world to help promote inclusion within the R community. 
* **Customizability:** Because R is open-source, you can change just about anything you like! With a little practice, you'll be able to create functions and graphics that perfectly match your own needs.
* **Beyond statistics:** You can use R to build a website (like this one), manage and share a code repository on GitHub, scrape and compile a social media database, or automatically generate word documents, slide presentations, and more! There are practically endless ways to use functional programming in R that have nothing to do with statistics at all. 

If you're a beginner, learning R can be a daunting task. *Keep at it!* And never hesitate to ask questions.
